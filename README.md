Having Fun with 2023 ACS micro data. 
In one project, we can explore income percentiles.
In the next, we explore a claim I have seen a lot in the media about declining marriage rates.

If interested, please reach out and I can help you download the necessary (and large) dataframes off ipums! 


Income percentiles uses the ACS 2023 5 year sample
Marriage rates uses ACS 1-year files 2000-2023
