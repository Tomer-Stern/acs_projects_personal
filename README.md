Personal Projects with Census Data. 
In one project, we can explore income percentiles.
In the next, we explore a claim I have seen a lot in the media about declining marriage rates.

If interested, please reach out and I can help you download the necessary (and large) dataframes off ipums! 


Income percentiles uses the ACS 2023 5 year sample
Marriage rates uses ACS 1-year files 2000-2023

Additionally, I have added a project using CPS Monthly data 2010-2025 where we try and predict if a college drop-out will re-enroll in school.
The raw data is very large as each person gets 8 observations (in the CPS, you get interviewed on 8 seperate months). However, the collapsed data
filtered to those with some college no BA is relatively small, and included.
